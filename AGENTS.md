# Agent Required Project Instructions

These instructions apply to Codex, Claude Code, and other coding agents working in this repository.

## Must Read

- [docs/development/i18n.md](docs/development/i18n.md) is the mandatory internationalization standard.
- Frontend changes must follow [docs/design/web/04-frontend.md](docs/design/web/04-frontend.md) unless a newer implementation pattern exists in code.

## Internationalization Gate

All new user-facing product text must go through the project i18n layer. This includes labels, buttons, placeholders, tooltips, empty states, validation messages, toast/message/notification text, modal titles, table columns, navigation labels, status labels, browser page text, and fallback HTML.

Allowed exceptions are listed in the i18n standard. If a change intentionally leaves user-facing text untranslated, document why in the PR or task summary.
